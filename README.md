Prediction Assignment
The measurement data were collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 
participants. Participants performed barbell lifts, correctly and incorrectly, in 5 different
ways. The five different ways corresponded to the "classe" variable with five levels 
(A B C D E).
   To calculate the out-of-sample error, the training data was split into a training set and a 
test set.  
   The goal of this assignment was to predict classe given the measurement data variables.
